## Assignment 2, CS 431/531, Fall 2018

Due: 2018-10-24

Points available: 20

### Additional methods 

* no new methods

### Additional status codes 

* 301 Moved Permanently
 * if "/foo" is a directory, the server should 301 redirect to "/foo/"
* 302 Found
 * takes a configurable list of regular expressions and provides URIs that the server should 302 redirect to 
* 304 Not Modified
* 408 Request Timeout
* 412 Precondition Failed


### Additional request headers 

* Connection: close
 * is now optional; its absence means the request is long-lived
* If-Modified-Since
* If-Unmodified-Since
* If-Match
* If-None-Match


### Additional response headers

* ETag
* Location

### Notes

* Support both long-lived and pipelined connections
* Use a default of 15 seconds for timeouts (specify in a config file)
* Only compute "strong" ETags (come up with your own method)
* Any GET method that does not result in a 20X response code MUST have a text/html entity generated by the server explaining the response code (unless prohibited, like 304)
* in a config file, specify that `index.html` is the default resource name for when a URI ends in "/"
* if a directory does not have a default resource (i.e., `index.html`), then dynamically generate an HTML listing of the directories files (they should be clickable, with dates, sizes, etc.)
* create a separate config file that supports redirections of the form:


`#`  
`# Status: Incoming RE          Redirect URI`   
`#`   
`302: ^(.*)/coolcar.html$       $1/galaxie.html`   
`302: ^(.*)/1.[234]/(.*)                $1/1.1/$2`   
`301: ^(.*)/mercury/(.*)$       $1/ford/$2`
