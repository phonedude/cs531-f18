### Content-type: application/json
* find and post up to three different "in the wild" examples of APIs with MIME types of "application/json" that should be something else (and suggest what the MIME type should be).

### HTTP2 support
* find and post up to three different "in the wild" examples of HTTP2 support

### HTTP/1.1 design improvements
* during the semester we covered several areas where HTTP/1.1 could have been designed more consistently.  Provide up to three well-documented examples of what you would change in HTTP/1.1 (I'm not looking for features present in HTTP2, rather some of the syntax and consistency issues we discussed in class).  Document both how things are in HTTP/1.1 and what you would propose instead.  

### WARC file comparison
* Compare and contrast the resulting WARC files generating by 1) wget, 2) WARCreate.com, and 3) webrecorder.io on the URI: https://odu.edu/compsci
